        <h3>Nvwa is known as the mother goddess of Chinese mythology and is celebrated for creating humanity and repairing the order of heaven and Earth. The goddess created a different creature on the first eight days of Chinese New Year, and on the seventh day, humans were born. 
            Nvwa was said to have created humans out of yellow clay. However, after realising that the ears would not withstand the cold in the winter, she sowed the ears in place and put the thread in the humans mouths. To thank Nvwa for the creation of humans, people shaped dough into the shape of ears, and stuffed it with meat and vegetables. And that is how dumplings were born.<br> Click DUMPLINGS to go back card!
