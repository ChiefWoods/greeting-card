          the
          way to Jan 21 of 2023. The Tiger ranks third in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac signs. The Years of

        <p>Tigers, considered to be brave, cruel, forceful, and terrifying, are the symbol of power and lordliness in
          Chinese culture. In ancient times, people usually compared emperors or kings with the tigers. Tigers are also
          considered as a patron deity for children and parents will prepare the shoes and hats with tiger designs for
