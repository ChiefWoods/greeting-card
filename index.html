            <p>The Jade Emperor, a well-known figure in Chinese mythology, is the ruler of heaven and known as the
              first emperor of China. He organised a race on his birthday and invited twelve animals to take part in
              it. As the prize, a year in the zodiac will be named after each one and the race would determine the
              order of each animal.</p>
            <p>
              The large river was the final obstacle of the race, and when the ox and the rat were about to cross, the
              rat persuaded the ox to let it sit on the head of ox to cross the water. As the two neared the finish
              line, however, the rat dashed to the finish line, becoming the first animal in the zodiac and the ox
              became second.</p>
            <p>
              Then followed the tiger, which was slowed down by the river. For fourth place, the rabbit hung on a
              floating log to avoid being swept away by harsh waves and was brought ashore thanks to the dragon
              breath. The dragon, who stepped away from the race to extinguish a fire at a nearby village therefore
              won number five . The horse was slightly behind from the dragon and was about to be placed number six
              when the snake slithered off from its leg, causing him to lose his balance—and the sixth place. The
              snake took sixth place and the horse was placed seventh.</p>
            <p>
              The goat, monkey and rooster teamed up together to make a raft to cross the river. The goat ran to the
              finish line, followed by the monkey and the rooster. The dog, the eleventh animal in the zodiac
              calendar, got distracted by the water and decided to play in it and lost track of time.
              The story could have ended here, as the emperor almost gave up on waiting for the pig. The pig had
              gotten hungry during the middle of the race and stopped for a bite to eat. Which of course, was followed
              by a nap. After it finally woke up, the animal finished the race and was placed twelfth.</p>

            <p>It seems like there were an awful amount of demons and monsters in ancient China. If you love receiving
              red packets during Chinese New Year, you will have Demon Sui to thank. In the myth, Demon Sui would
              arrive on the night of New Year Eve to harm children. Children were so terrified of the demon that
              instead of crying, they would come down with a fever so severe that it will lead to mental instability.
              To protect the children from the demon, parents would light candles and pray to gods for protection. One
              day, a family decided to give eight coins to the child to play with and keep him entertained. When the
              child fell asleep, the parents placed the coins in a red paper underneath the pillow. The same night,
              Sui visited the home of the child but when it tried to touch his head, the coins emitted a strong light
              and scared the monster away.</p>
            <p>
              Turns out, the gods heard the prayers and sent eight guards disguised as the coins to protect the child.
              From that moment onwards, the tradition of giving red envelopes to children to keep them safe and bring
              good luck began.</p>

            <p>Nvwa is known as the mother goddess of Chinese mythology and is celebrated for creating humanity and
              repairing the order of heaven and Earth. The goddess created a different creature on the first eight
              days of Chinese New Year, and on the seventh day, humans were born. Nvwa was said to have created humans
              out of yellow clay. However, after realising that the ears would not withstand the cold in the winter,
              she sowed the ears in place and put the thread in the humans mouths. To thank Nvwa for the creation of
              humans, people shaped dough into the shape of ears, and stuffed it with meat and vegetables. And that is
              how dumplings were born.</p>

          <p>2022 is the Year of the Tiger according to Chinese zodiac, which begins from the Feb 1 of 2022, lasting all
            the
            way to Jan 21 of 2023. The Tiger ranks third in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac signs. The Years of
            the
            Tiger include 1914, 1926, 1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2010, 2022, 2034 and so on.</p>
          <p>Tigers, considered to be brave, cruel, forceful, and terrifying, are the symbol of power and lordliness in
            Chinese culture. In ancient times, people usually compared emperors or kings with the tigers. Tigers are
            also
            considered as a patron deity for children and parents will prepare the shoes and hats with tiger designs for
            their babies.</p>
          <p>The Chinese zodiac Tiger sign entitles people born in the Years of the Tiger to be natural leaders. They
            are
            adventurous, ambitious and have a strong sense of justice, but maybe also a little arrogant and
            impetuous.<br><br><span>To learn more about the zodiac tiger, click on the Chinese letter on the
